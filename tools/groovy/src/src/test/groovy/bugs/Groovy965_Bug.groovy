/**
 * A test case to ensure that Groovy can compile class names and variable names with non-ASCII
 * characters and that non-ASCII characters in Strings do the right thing.
 * <p>
 * Unfortunately, we cannot actually have this test in the Subversion store since it
 * requires having an encoding.  Java internally uses UTF-16.  Most Linux/UNIX/Mac OS X users
 * use UTF-8 (or if they haven't caught up yet ISO-8859-{1..15], in Europe anyway).  Windows
 * internally is UTF-16 LE but it appears that the Europe region defaults to ISO-8859-1 which
 * is very silly.  All in all we cannot guarantee an encoding so we cannot have the tests.
 * <p>
 * If anyone spots any errors in the rationale or finds a way to fix things please update at will.
